# TSSKEA
We propose a Two-Stage Sparse Knowledge-Guided Evolutionary Algorithm (TSSKEA) by incorporating network degree knowledge of molecular interaction network and sparse knowledge from the populationâ€™s historical and current non-dominated solutions into multiobjective multimodal optimization process.
